= Version 2.0 on 2009-06-13 =
 * Display frequency response curves in the UI
 * GUI layout improvements
 * Switch to DSP code to one from FIL-plugins-0.3.0 and change URI to
   reflect parameter tweaks. The new filter will 'feel' different in
   particular the interaction between gain and bandwidth. This version
   is much closer to what you'll find in the best analog (and digital)
   mixers. But it's still the same filter, only the mapping of
   parameter values to responses has changed.
 * Fix restoring of plugin UI state

= Version 1.1 on 2009-06-06 =
 * Two plugins, stereo and mono
 * Basic GUI

= Version 1 on 2009-06-03 =
 * Initial release, GUI-less mono plugin based on FIL-plugins-0.1.0
