= Compile-time requirements =
 * lv2core

= Run-time requirements = 
 * pygtk
 * pycairo

= Configure it =

./waf configure

By default waf will try to autodetect where to install the plugin by
checking the LV2_PATH environment variable.
If you don't have LV2_PATH set or if you want to override install
location, you need to use the --lv2-dir switch. You have to specify
full normalized path (i.e. /home/usesrname/xxx instead of ~/xxx).

./waf configure --lv2-dir=/usr/lib/lv2

For full list of options, run:

./waf configure --help

= Build it =

./waf

You can use -j option to enable building on more than one CPU:

./waf -j 4

= Install it =

./waf install

You probably want to run later as superuser to install system-wide
